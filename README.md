Weather Classification Project

**Project Overview**
This project builds a machine learning model to classify weather conditions using weather-related features. The model is trained using a Random Forest Classifier.

**Dataset**
Weather Type classification data is used from Kaggle. The dataset includes various features, with 'Weather Type' as the target variable.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
After loading the dataset, categorical and numerical columns were separated to better understand the data.
Checked for any null values and handled them to ensure data quality.

**Feature Selection**
Selected key features, focusing on the 'Weather Type' as the target variable for training the model.

**Model Training**
Applied a Random Forest Classifier to classify the weather type.
The Random Forest Classifier is chosen for its robustness and suitability for various classification tasks.
The model achieved an accuracy of 91.5%.

**Conclusion**
The Random Forest Classifier effectively classifies weather conditions with high accuracy, making it a reliable choice for weather classification tasks.
